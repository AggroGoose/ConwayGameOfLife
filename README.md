# Conway's Game of Life C++

Followed a tutorial to build a basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life using C++ with SDL2 as the renderer. Details of the tutorial only covered the basics of the C++ logic. As my first foray into a C++ project outside of the syntax courses, working this project required me to learn how to add and configure an external library (SDL) and trace compilation bugs related to computer configuration and pathing (env variables).
